The project involves building a website for "Backroads Tour Company" using Flexbox for all layouts. Key sections include:

- **Nav Bar**: Contains a logo, links, and social media icons arranged horizontally using Flexbox.
- **Hero Section**: Features a heading, paragraph, and call-to-action button centered with Flexbox.
- **Bold Section**: A two-column layout with text and image, adjusting to one column on smaller screens.
- **Services Section**: A three-column layout on larger screens, with each service using Flexbox for side-by-side alignment of icons and text.
- **Tours Section**: Cards displaying tour information, with hover effects that change the box shadow and increase card size.
- **Contact Section**: A form where inputs and buttons are aligned with Flexbox.
- **Gallery**: Four images across a row, responsive to screen size changes.
- **Footer**: Contains links, social media icons, and a copyright section.

The project includes responsive design, adapting layouts to different screen sizes. JavaScript is added for interactive features like smooth scrolling, a responsive nav bar, and dynamically updating the current year. The project reuses existing HTML structure for efficiency while focusing on implementing CSS and JavaScript for functionality.
